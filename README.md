# Araxiel's Artillery for Self-Propelled

> [!NOTE]
> 26/09/24: I updated and changed this mod in 2021 into a new mod I called Adordenances. I uploaded that mod on the steam workshop, but didn't feel like making it into a new repository. As of I'm adding this note, I've yet to make it into a new repository, and I've yet to fully decide if I'm gonna do it or not, because this would be making a repository for a mod that's already 3 years out of date right now, and has minimal changes.

## What does this mod do?
This mod is a mod that improves the light tanks.

## Is this finished?
Yes. Maybe if I got a little idea I might add it. And of course updating it for the newest HoI4 version.

## Where can you download this mod?
This mod can exclusively be found on the Steam Workshop. If this mod is found anywhere else (unless specified otherwise here), it's an illegitimate and unauthorized re-upload.

## Can others contribute?
The initial answer for that is no, this mod is a one-man project. If someone really wants to contribute, then they should message me and we can make a separate mod or something.

## Can I modify this mod/use the code?
Well, I can't really stop anyone from doing that. It's also not really an issue, but if you genuinely take parts of this mod for yourself, give me some credit or simply message me; I don't mind helping and don't bite.
